#YAML example charts of my Kubernetes homelab projects
This repository contains example YAML charts for a selection of my personal homelab applications. 

Note:These templates are specifically designed for *non-production environments* and/or tailored for my personal local homelab setup!
For public and production environments, the templates need to be updated to be secure and up to date.

The goal is to add charts for all of the applications listed below hosted in my homelab setup:
